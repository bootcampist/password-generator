# password-generator


## Description

The Password Generator uses JavaScript to generate a random password based on the user’s input criteria. The user is able to specify the length and character types for the password and the input is stored in an object. The generator also features a character check to ensure the generated password contains the character types the user selected. HTML, CSS and Photoshop were used to add styling to the Password Generator.

## Usage

The aim of the website is to generate a password composed of random characters specified by the user. Originally, the user’s input was captured using prompt and confirm methods. However, this was then modified to a form for a better user experience. After the form has been filled in and the ‘Generate Password’ button pressed, the user’s randomly generated password is displayed on the page.
